					Below you will find details of each movement of the work. 
					Please note, the score excerpts shown here were designed as a personal shorthand for the two of us and were never ‘finalised’ for public viewing.
					So, for all composers who are experts in professional notation, please stop scrolling now!

						<h3 class="notation-h2">Movement One: Closeness [6']</h3>
						<p>
							Hamish and Niki stand opposite each other. Hamish on bamboo instruments, Niki on a table of ceramics. They begin their opening gesture in unison on their different instruments. 
							<br>
							Closeness explores unison gesture, and the texture, microtonal pitches and resonance of the bamboo and ceramic instruments. This movement is small and intimate, gentle and introspective, as the players watch each other carefully to catch and match each other's playing gesture, working in symmetry or slowly departing to play in accompanying opposition. Closeness is reflected in careful consideration of the other, watching, physical closeness and occasional perfect togetherness. The players' physical positions, observing and facing each other make us consider the ways we communicate, and how we manifest actions and sounds with our bodies.

						<h3 class="notation-h2">Movement Two: Meeting Place [5']</h3>
						<p>Niki and Hamish begin to play rhythmic motifs, a clear departure from the textural exploration of movement one. An electronic track enters with rhythmic grooves made from samples of the bamboo instruments.
							<br>
							Movement two explores a ‘meeting place’ where Hamish and Niki share the bamboo instruments and play interlocking groove motifs. This section is driving and reveals textures and colours of the bamboo instruments through use of knitting needles, soft yarn mallets and articulate yarn mallets. Groove patterns give way to ricochet scrapes. The players fade in and fade in throughout to give the impression of waves of sound interlocking, ebbing and flowing. Halfway through, the two players leave the bamboo and come to play together on the ceramic instruments, exploring the texture and pitch combinations of multiple ceramic instruments sounding at once.

							<h3 class="notation-h2">Movement Three: Distance [3'30"]</h3>
							<p>Hamish and Niki on opposite sides of the stage stand behind their individual pieces of bamboo. Watching each other from a distance, and listening out for each other’s sounds, the two try to navigate the physical separation in a process of making sound.
								<br>
								The third and final movement explores the ways we listen and communicate over physical distance. The players create sounds from bamboo instruments, reinforced with contact microphones attached directly to the pieces of bamboo, creating wailing and microtonal scraping sounds. Eventually, the two find ways to bridge the distance through sound and movement.
