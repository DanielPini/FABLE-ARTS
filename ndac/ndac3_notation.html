        Below you will find details of each movement of the work. Please note,
        the score excerpts shown here were designed as a personal shorthand for
        the two of us and were never ‘finalised’ for public viewing. So, for all
        composers who are experts in professional notation, please stop

      </h2>
      <div class="notation-movement">
        <h3 class="notation-h2">Movement One: Closeness [6']</h3>
        <p>
          Hamish and Niki stand opposite each other. Hamish on bamboo
          instruments, Niki on a table of ceramics. They begin their opening
          gesture in unison on their different instruments.
          <br />
          Closeness explores unison gesture, and the texture, microtonal pitches
          and resonance of the bamboo and ceramic instruments. This movement is
          small and intimate, gentle and introspective, as the players watch
          each other carefully to catch and match each other's playing gesture,
          working in symmetry or slowly departing to play in accompanying
          opposition. Closeness is reflected in careful consideration of the
          other, watching, physical closeness and occasional perfect
          togetherness. The players' physical positions, observing and facing
          each other make us consider the ways we communicate, and how we
          manifest actions and sounds with our bodies.

      <div class="notation-movement">
        <h3 class="notation-h2">Movement Two: Meeting Place [5']</h3>
        <p>
          Niki and Hamish begin to play rhythmic motifs, a clear departure from
          the textural exploration of movement one. An electronic track enters
          with rhythmic grooves made from samples of the bamboo instruments.
          <br />
          Movement two explores a ‘meeting place’ where Hamish and Niki share
          the bamboo instruments and play interlocking groove motifs. This
          section is driving and reveals textures and colours of the bamboo
          instruments through use of knitting needles, soft yarn mallets and
          articulate yarn mallets. Groove patterns give way to ricochet scrapes.
          The players fade in and fade in throughout to give the impression of
          waves of sound interlocking, ebbing and flowing. Halfway through, the
          two players leave the bamboo and come to play together on the ceramic
          instruments, exploring the texture and pitch combinations of multiple
          ceramic instruments sounding at once.

        <h3 class="notation-h2">Movement Three: Distance [3'30"]</h3>
        <p>
          Hamish and Niki on opposite sides of the stage stand behind their
          individual pieces of bamboo. Watching each other from a distance, and
          listening out for each other’s sounds, the two try to navigate the
          physical separation in a process of making sound.
          <br />
          The third and final movement explores the ways we listen and
          communicate over physical distance. The players create sounds from
          bamboo instruments, reinforced with contact microphones attached
          directly to the pieces of bamboo, creating wailing and microtonal
          scraping sounds. Eventually, the two find ways to bridge the distance
          through sound and movement.
