					<h2>Ceramics</h2>
					<p>
						Just like many others in the long and solitary COVID lockdowns of
						the early 2020s, Niki took up some new creative hobbies to pass the
						time. For her, these included making vases out of clay, drawing on
						some deep memories of clay making as a child, combined with some
						encouragement and tips from her housemate Solomon Frank whose mother
						is a ceramicist. The end result was a series of wonky and voluptuous
						objects, with what appeared to be ‘ladders’ running up and down the
						sides. The next step in these trying lockdown times was to find a
						ceramic studio open and available for public drop-in firing, but
						after some research, Sydney Clay was happy to take in these strange
						forms and fire them, turning the clay from greenware (wet and a bit
						leathery) to bisque (hard, brittle and ready to last a long time
						unless dropped).

				<div class="descriptiveText">
					<p>
						Their textual surfaces and cavernous spaces made them tantalising
						invitations to touch and draw sound. Blame the percussionist
						training in Niki to ‘find sound in any object’, but it did not feel
						like quite a big leap to take a few sticks and mallets to them after
						they had come out of the kiln, crispy and lumpy. It was in a process
						of experimenting with ratan mallet handles, and glass and plastic
						glockenspiel and xylophone mallets, that Niki discovered the unique
						microtonal pitches within each object and across the set, as well as
						delicate and brittle timbres. Scraping and taping led to tinkling,
						and surprisingly resonant, sounds.

					<h2>Bamboo</h2>
					<p>
						Thinking that perhaps there was something interesting here, Niki
						approached colleague and percussionist friend Hamish Upton, asking
						if he thought there was some musical merit in these new objects.
						From there the two percussionists set about scheming a musical and
						performative work with only new instruments made from natural
						materials. Hamish was particularly interested in the ‘ladder’
						element of the ceramics which created a guiro-like effect when
						scraped. Guiros, for context, are instruments with a serrated
						surface originally made from a gourd that creating a rasping sound
						when scraped, and are traditionally used in Latin American music.
						Combining the guiro with the ceramic ladder idea, Hamish set about
						sourcing different length of bamboo and carving grooves into them.
						As Hamish experimented with the sounds of his bamboo guiros, he
						found he had successfully created a rasp-able instrument, with a new
						and distinctly bamboo resonant timbre. This timbre had a long decay
						and a series of low fundamental pitches, combined with higher
						partials in the moment of scrape.

					<p>
						With the slowly growing collection of bamboo and ceramic
						instruments, the two percussionists set about creating a work for
						the Speak Percussion Bespoke program of which the artists were a
						part of. The work Hamish and Niki planned, took these instruments
						and created a musical composition and public performance featuring
						exclusively the sounds of the new instruments. In a process of
						developing the musical composition, the artists considered the key
						themes shaping their collaboration.

					<h2>Distance and Closeness</h2>
					<p>
						The major factor affecting this early stage of the work development,
						was that each artist was based in a different city, (Niki in Sydney
						and Hamish in Melbourne) so the artists communicated via zoom, calls
						and emails in a process of creating their part of the work across a
						great distance. It was this process of collaborating that led the
						artists to explore closeness and distance as key themes of the work.
						In considering the ways this theme could be both in the musical
						composition and the physical performance, the artists explored a
						potential presentation model involving multiple percussion setups,
						some far away from each other, and some right next to each other.
						Here, during performance, the artists would at times be on opposite
						sides of the room trying to hear and be heard across a vast
						distance, and at other times, side by side sharing the same
						instrument. With this compositional idea in mind, the artist set
						about designing the installation element of presenting the work.

					<h2>Installation</h2>
					<p>
						Experimenting with how to present the bamboo and ceramics, the
						artists explored suspending the bamboo for maximum resonance, and
						placing the ceramics on a sturdy table to minimise their break.

						As the artists wanted the work to highlight the new sculptural
						instruments, they decided to steer away from using conventional
						percussion infrastructure - in this way, drawing attention to the
						visual design of the new instruments in an almost sculptural
						context. As such, they designed a table for the ceramics
						(affectionately termed the ‘macaroni’ table as its shape enveloped
						the player standing inside) and a tripod setup that suspended the
						bamboo.
