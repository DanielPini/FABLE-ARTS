        <p>Did you know that we have a book club?</p>
        <p>
          <br />Sign up throuh our contact page. Just put FA Book Club as the
          subject and let us know what you're interested in reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />Each year we suggest a short-list of books from which the
          community can vote. The 3 winning titles then are released for the
          book club from February to June, July to October, and November to
          January. <br /><br />Our favourite books are those from our artists,
          or those which talk about how to use art to improve the human
          condition. After reading, we have a discussion available to those who
          sign up through our Discord
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />We'd also love to hear your suggestions, either on the Discord,
          or through our contact page.
