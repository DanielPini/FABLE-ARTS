          <br />
          So Nikki, what is different about writing for the instruments that we
          made? <br /><br />
          I guess we have this exciting opportunity to find out what sounds are
          specific to these objects. So here are some of the ceramic pieces that
          we used and they've got these really kind of bizarre shapes – these
          grooves which I called ladders – and because they're vessels they also
          have resonating chambers, so that there's quite a bit of resonance
          when you strike them, and lots of different pitches. So what's
          different about for new instruments I guess you get to find out all
          like what the sounds are like, all those sounds I just said, and then
          work out how you want to compose for them. <br /><br />It's also worth
          noting that Nikki made these before the bamboo concept, so you can see
          the bamboo here has these ridges and they're kind of spaced out
          differently along the instrument, so as you move along the bamboo
          you've got more scrapey sounds and slower scrapey sounds down that end
          and that was actually inspired by the resonating Chambers that these
          handmade ceramic instruments have, so each of these cells on the
          bamboo is its own resonating chamber, so these bamboo instruments were
          sort of informed by this. <br /><br />So the whole work is kind of
          created from that concept of the instruments working together in
          tandem, so the notation for this work uses a combination of graphic
          notation and some text scores. And I chose to use graphic notation for
          the first movement because I was interested in exploring how we could
          synchronize gestures, so a lot of the graphic notation sort of signals
          certain gestures as you can see in our score wherever it appears on
          the screen. <br /><br />The first passage is these vertical lines that
          change in height which demonstrate gestures changing in length, so
          yeah I chose to use graphic notation to help explore gesture and also
          because we wanted that first movement to be quite improvised so the
          graphic notation allowed us to explore certain textures and density of
          sound whilst having a lot of freedom in the specific gestures and
          rhythms that we played.

        <p>
          Hamish and Niki stand opposite each other. Hamish on bamboo
          instruments, Niki on a table of ceramics. They begin their opening
          gesture in unison on their different instruments.
          <br />
          Closeness explores unison gesture, and the texture, microtonal pitches
          and resonance of the bamboo and ceramic instruments. This movement is
          small and intimate, gentle and introspective, as the players watch
          each other carefully to catch and match each other's playing gesture,
          working in symmetry or slowly departing to play in accompanying
          opposition. Closeness is reflected in careful consideration of the
          other, watching, physical closeness and occasional perfect
          togetherness. The players' physical positions, observing and facing
          each other make us consider the ways we communicate, and how we
          manifest actions and sounds with our bodies.

        <h3 class="notation-h2">Movement Two: Meeting Place [5']</h3>
        <p>
          Niki and Hamish begin to play rhythmic motifs, a clear departure from
          the textural exploration of movement one. An electronic track enters
          with rhythmic grooves made from samples of the bamboo instruments.
          <br />
          Movement two explores a ‘meeting place’ where Hamish and Niki share
          the bamboo instruments and play interlocking groove motifs. This
          section is driving and reveals textures and colours of the bamboo
          instruments through use of knitting needles, soft yarn mallets and
          articulate yarn mallets. Groove patterns give way to ricochet scrapes.
          The players fade in and fade out throughout to give the impression of
          waves of sound interlocking, ebbing and flowing. Halfway through, the
          two players leave the bamboo and come to play together on the ceramic
          instruments, exploring the texture and pitch combinations of multiple
          ceramic instruments sounding at once.

              <br />
              Nikki sent me structure of a score for the second movement that
              had a tempo and then a lot of bar numbers, or numbers of bars, or
              musical measures for each little section. And from that I was able
              to sample the bamboo sample these little kind of Loops that
              matched the lengths of the score that Nikki sent, and then I
              created some electronics parts that went with that a bit of a
              baseline to kind of add to the energy in the intensity.
              <br /><br />So the second movement you'll hear has a very strong
              rhythmic pulse in comparison to the first movement and the
              notation allowed us to work with these knitting needle sounds and
              also using, you know, very rhythmic mallets it's traditional
              percussive mallets on the bamboo to create that rhythmic drive and
              kind of hollow sound that you get from the bamboo.
              <br /><br />It's also worth noting we used um surface contact
              microphones on the bamboo to really capture the sounds that you
              could get out of these ridges, the kind of guiro ridges that were
              carved into the bamboo, and for this movement the text notation
              allowed us to be a little bit more strict with what we were
              playing so we had sort of a bar number certain numbers of times
              that we repeat things that would synchronize with the electronic
              track, so movement two is much more driving and groovy than the
              first movement which is much more textural. <br /><br />All of the
              recordings in the second movement for the electronics part were
              made using the bamboo and I used a whole heap of different mallets
              so there were hot rods which are these kind of um if you imagine
              getting a bunch of skewers and taking together the those mallets
              there were Jazz brushes there were really heavy marimba mallets
              and little knitting needles all to create this sort of layers of
              spectrums of texture um that drew out all the different sounds of
              the bamboo um in the electronics parts.

        <p>
          Hamish and Niki on opposite sides of the stage stand behind their
          individual pieces of bamboo. Watching each other from a distance, and
          listening out for each other’s sounds, the two try to navigate the
          physical separation in a process of making sound.
          <br />
          The third and final movement explores the ways we listen and
          communicate over physical distance. The players create sounds from
          bamboo instruments, reinforced with contact microphones attached
          directly to the pieces of bamboo, creating wailing and microtonal
          scraping sounds. Eventually, the two find ways to bridge the distance
          through sound and movement.

          <br />
          For the third movement, we took a while to work out how we wanted to
          close the piece, so it had this very textural opening and the opening
          was only ceramics too, so we had, you know, that was our brief.
          <br /><br />Movement one of ceramics, movement two is bamboo,
          electronics, so, yeah, the third movement brings together beautifully
          the ceramics and the bamboo and we decided to start by drawing these
          long sustained sounds out of the bamboo using super-ball mallets, so
          essentially mallets with a bounce ball stick attached that drag along
          – and you'll see that in the video – to create sort of moaning texture
          out of the bamboo, and that interacted with very delicate rhythmic
          tapping on the ceramics. We wanted to explore space, so the whole
          piece is around navigating distance, so we decided to walk around the
          space holding these fragile instruments to create a spatialized effect
          for the audience, after we were finished using our super-balls on the
          bamboo. <br /><br />And it's also important to note that the third
          movement is the movement that explores distance the most, so for the
          first part of that section where we're playing on the bamboo we are
          physically separated, so we're really far away from each other on
          opposite sides of the venue. So first movement we're close together
          right facing each other. Second movement we're sharing an instrument.
          <br /><br />And then this third movement we're physically separated,
          and then we roam around the space can sort of physically come together
          at the end holding our [gesture at ceramics]. <br /><br />Something
          important I'd like to note is that these scores were actually for our
          eyes only, and so if there are any composers out there who are
          specialized in beautiful notation, you have to stop the video now
          right now, cuz there’s scribbling every, it's all a mess, so it's
          just, it's just actually notation for us yeah to sort of help us with
          improvisations or know the structure and it definitely is not sort of,
          yeah was really designed for us to play, because we designed it from
          scratch. <br /><br />So yeah we'll have the scores accessible to you
          if you'd like to have a look and try to follow along when you watch
          the documentation of the performance, but not sure how clear it will
          be for others to try and interpret our notation. Enjoy the
          performance.
