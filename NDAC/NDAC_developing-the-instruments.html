            In early 2020, Niki made a series of wonky and voluptuous clay
            ‘vases’ that had ladder-like grooves running up and down the sides.
            Though not intended to be musical instruments, their crispy, lumpy
            and textured surfaces, as well as their cavernous inside spaces,
            made them tantalising invitations to touch and draw sound from.

              In a process of experimenting with rattan mallet handles, and
              glass and plastic glockenspiel and xylophone mallets, Niki
              discovered the unique microtonal pitches and delicate and brittle
              timbres within each object and across the set..Playing gestures
              such as scraping and tapping led to tinkling, and surprisingly

            Thinking that perhaps there was something interesting here, Niki
            approached colleague and percussionist friend Hamish Upton, asking
            if he thought there was some musical merit in these new objects.
            From here, the two percussionists set about scheming a musical and
            performative work with new instruments made only from natural
            materials. Hamish was particularly interested in the ‘ladder’
            element of the ceramics which created a guiro-like effect when
            scraped. Guiros, for context, are instruments with a serrated
            surface originally made from a gourd that creates a rasping sound
            when scraped, and are traditionally used in Latin American music.
            Combining the guiro with the ceramic ladder idea, Hamish set about
            sourcing different lengths of bamboo and carving grooves into them.
            As Hamish experimented with the sounds of his bamboo guiros, he
            found he had successfully created a rasp-able instrument, with a new
            and distinctly bamboo resonant timbre. This timbre had a long decay
            and a series of low fundamental pitches, combined with higher
            partials in the moment of scrape.

              With the slowly growing collection of bamboo and ceramic
              instruments, the two percussionists set about creating a work for

              instruments. In a process of developing the musical composition,
              the artists considered the key themes shaping their collaboration.

          <h2>Distance and Closeness</h2>
          <p>
            The major factor affecting this early stage of the work development,
            was that each artist was based in a different city, (Niki in Sydney
            and Hamish in Melbourne) so the artists communicated via zoom, calls
            and emails in a process of creating their part of the work across a
            great distance. They set out to find the commonalities and contrasts
            in the texture, sound, and playability of their respective
            instruments, sending each other sound clips and videos of prototype
            sounds and compositional ideas. It was this process of collaborating
            that led the artists to explore closeness and distance as key themes
            of the work. In considering the ways this theme could be both in the
            musical composition and the physical performance, the artists
            explored a potential presentation model involving multiple
            percussion setups, some far away from each other, and some right
            next to each other. Here, during performance, the artists would at
            times be on opposite sides of the room trying to hear and be heard
            across a vast distance, and at other times, side by side sharing the
            same instrument. With this compositional idea in mind, the artist
            set about designing the installation element of presenting the work.

            Experimenting with how to present the bamboo and ceramics, the
            artists explored suspending the bamboo for maximum resonance, and
            placing the ceramics on a sturdy table to minimise their chance of

                As the artists wanted the work to highlight the new sculptural
                instruments, they decided to steer away from using conventional
                percussion infrastructure - in this way, drawing attention to
                the visual design of the new instruments in an almost sculptural
                context. As such, they designed a table for the ceramics
                (affectionately termed the ‘macaroni’ table as its shape
                enveloped the player standing inside) and a tripod setup that
                suspended the bamboo. Both setups supported the instruments in a
                unique playing position, inviting new ways to perform on the
                instruments in space across stacked horizontal planes and
                semi-circular layouts.
